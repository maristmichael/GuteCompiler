# GuteCompiler
## Overview
This is a compiler that will be built from scratch using Python3.

## Requirements
- Python3.7

## Running the Compiler
In a terminal or command line, navigate to the directory of the project.

Give executable permissions to the setup.sh file with `chmod +x setup.sh` to make life easy for you.

After prompted a Python3.7 version check, you are ready to use my compiler.

Simply type `gutec -f path_to_a_file` to compile a file.

As of now, the compiler can only perform lexical analysis but more will come...
